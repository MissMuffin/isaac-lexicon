If you have 40 bombs it will spawn 4 x Boom! pedestal items\n\nPicking up all dropped items leaves you with the same health and consumables you had before\n\nThis allows you to manipulate your consumables in lots of different ways, for example by rerolling them with the D6/D20, re-arrange your Bone heart containers and more\n\nIf you have the Tarot Cloth item, this card will also drop all your passive items on the floor as pedestals\n\n",
